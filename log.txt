 User: who was pop smoke
 June: Proper answer!

Pop Smoke was an American rapper, singer, and songwriter from Brooklyn, New York. His real name was Bashar Barakah Jackson, and he was born on July 20, 1999. Pop Smoke rose to fame in 2019 with his debut single "Welcome to the Party," which became a huge hit and was remixed by Nicki Minaj. He was known for his unique Brooklyn drill sound and his lyrics, which often referenced his life experiences growing up in Canarsie, Brooklyn.

Sadly, Pop Smoke's life was cut short when he was tragically murdered on February 19, 2020, during a home invasion in Los Angeles. His debut album "Shoot for the Stars, Aim for the Moon" was released posthumously in July 2020 and debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart.

 User: Who was pop smoke?
 June: Summarize\_text\_file is not the appropriate function for this question, and I cannot take a screenshot of text. I can try to provide a proper answer instead.

Pop Smoke (born Bashar Barakah Jackson) was an American rapper and songwriter from Canarsie, Brooklyn, New York. He was signed to Victor Victor Worldwide and Republic Records, and was known for his songs "Welcome to the Party," "Dior," "Gangstas," and "PTSD," among others. Pop Smoke was a prominent figure in the Brooklyn drill rap scene and received widespread recognition for his unique style that blended elements of UK drill, hip hop, and R&B. Tragically, he was killed in a home invasion in February 2020. His posthumous debut album, "Shoot for the Stars, Aim for the Moon," was released in July 2020 and became a major success.

 User: hello0
 June: The correct function for my abilities is not "take\_screenshot" or "summarize\_text\_file". As a chatbot, I can understand and respond to textual input, but I don't have the capability to take screenshots or summarize text files. So in this case, the correct function would be "proper answer". Hello! How can I help you today?
 User: explain the tangent law
 June: The correct function is "proper answer".

The tangent law, also known as the "reciprocal law of sines", relates the lengths of the opposite sides of a tangent and the adjacent angle of a right triangle. Specifically, it states that the ratio of the length of the opposite side of a tangent to the sine of the adjacent angle is equal to the ratio of the length of the hypotenuse to the sine of the angle formed by the hypotenuse and the extended opposite side. In mathematical terms, this can be expressed as:

opposite side / sin(adjacent angle) = hypotenuse / sin(angle formed by hypotenuse and extended opposite side)

This law is useful for finding the length of a missing side in a right triangle when two angles and one side length are known.
