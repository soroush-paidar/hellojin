don't mind me js fucking around w diff apis

* i'm kinda continuing what i was trying to do with heysosa but with some sort of multimodal input support
* so far i've implemented functions such as screenshotting, chat logs, etc
* also trying to add stuff like using the chat logs + prior convos as context
* right now the llm im using to automate functions based on input is kinda wonky so i have to train it on data
