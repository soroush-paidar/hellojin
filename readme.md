# hellojin

don't mind me js fucking around w diff apis

* i'm kinda continuing what i was trying to do with heysosa but with some sort of multimodal input support
* so far i've implemented functions such as screenshotting, chat logs, etc
* also trying to add stuff like using the chat logs + prior convos as context
* right now the llm im using to automate functions based on input is kinda wonky so i have to train it on data
* ^^ working on a dataset to train it on: https://huggingface.co/datasets/swooush/jins-dataset

## **currently working on:**

* developing a dataset to retrain the function selection model (probably gonna replace the model as well)
* fix document input
* get camera input working
* add model to actually use inputs
